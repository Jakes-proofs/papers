            On this site I host maths papers that I have written, I write them as an exersise in both proof writing and mathmatical thinking and aslo because I enjoy doing it. The papers are not intended to be actule disvories 
            and will certainly not contain anything of importance. If you notice any mistakes in or problems with any of the papers please contact me at jake248163264@gmail.com. Feel free to take inspiration from the papers
            and build off of my work should any of it intrest you, if you do so I would love to hear what ci=onclutions you investigation leads to.
