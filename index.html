            On this site I host maths papers that I have written, I write them as an exercise in both proof writing
            and mathematical thinking and also because I enjoy doing it. The papers are not intended to be actual discoveries
            and will certainly not contain anything of importance. If you notice any mistakes in or problems with any of the papers
            Please contact me at jake248163264@gmail.com. Feel free to take inspiration from the papers
            and build off of my work should any of it interest you, if you do so I would love to hear what conclusions your investigation leads to.
