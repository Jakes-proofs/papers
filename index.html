        <p>
            
            On this site I host maths papers that I have written, I write them as an exercise in both proof writing
            and mathematical thinking and also because I enjoy doing it. The papers are not intended to be actual discoveries
            and will certainly not contain anything of importance. If you notice any mistakes in or problems with any of the papers
            Please contact me at jake248163264@gmail.com. Feel free to take inspiration from the papers
            and build off of my work should any of it interest you, if you do so I would love to hear what conclusions your investigation leads to.

        <h2>Things I'm working on</h2>

            <p>
                Here are some of the things that I'm currently thinking about. It is not necessarily the case 
                that each of these will become a full paper because I'm just looking at them at the moment. 
                The numbers in the completion column represent how close I am to writing about that topic, these numbers 
                are hard to make accurate and can go up or down quickly depending on if I have just come up with a good 
                idea or if one I thought was promising turned out not to go anywhere so don't take them too seriously.
